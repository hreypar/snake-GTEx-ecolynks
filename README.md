This repository is about downloading RNA-seq data samples from the GTEx project and parsing them into an annotated matrix of the selected tissue.

## About ##

From the GTEx FAQ page:

*[How can I obtain gene expression data for my tissue of interest?](https://gtexportal.org/home/faq#geneExpressionByTissue)*

*Derived gene expression data can be downloaded from our [Download Page](https://dev.gtexportal.org/home/datasets). This data is available at the gene, transcript, and exon levels. The expression matrices contain one row per gene, exon, or transcript, and one column per sample. The column header contains the sample identifier. The sample annotation file, `GTEx_Analysis_v8_Annotations_SampleAttributesDS.txt`, contains the tissue site detail (in the SMTSD column) for every sample . You can write a simple script to join the gene expression file to the sample attribute file and filter for your tissue of interest.*
